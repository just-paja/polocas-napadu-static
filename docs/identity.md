# Help us define our brand looks!

We, Czech/Prague theatre-improvization group Poločas nápadu, are looking for someone to help us define our graphical identity on Internet and on paper. The main output should be **a document** with other resources that will help future graphic artists create multimedia for our promotion.

The document should be ballanced between being specific and readable.

*Throughout this document, we explain stuff about our group to help you understand the context.*

## What do we do

We are non-profit group of young actors. Difference between us and the classic theatre is that we have no script in advance, instead, our stories come to life in front of our audience and the audience helps us establish the content of the show.

## The name

*"Poločas nápadu"*. Yes, it's a Czech name, so your job is a little harder. The vague translation could be "Half-life of an idea" or "Idea half-life" based on [nuclear physics half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life), not the game. It is a wordplay in Czech language.

## Where does our brand live

Our brand lives several places on the internet and on few places in real world, both with the same level of importance.

### Online

* [Our website](https://polocas-napadu.cz/)
* On [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/polocas.napadu/) where we
  * share our events
  * publish our stories
* On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PolocasNapadu) where we sometimes tweet our shows, but with low priority, because Twitter is not a big thing in Czech republic.
* On YouTube, where we plan to share videos from our shows
* Websites of other institutions who promote us for some shows per season

### Real world

* On promo posters
* On our home stage where we meet
  * other improv groups,
  * with public as hosts,
  * with public as actors,
  * with other improvisers as kind of "hockey playes".
* In our training place where we meet
  * with each other,
  * sometimes with public.
* On networking events where we talk to other improvisers

## The Logo

We really like the main idea inside our logo. Yes, we can discuss logo colours and other improvements, but the main visual idea should not change.

Please help us define other variants of the logo and how it can be used in various graphic artwork. We also like to animate the logo, because we find it visually appealing (*and cheap*).

## Fonts

Please help us define what font is appropriate for our brand. Remember that our language uses **accented characters**. So far, we just use Open Sans.

## Brand colours

Please help us establish our brand colours. At the moment we add green as our background colour. Some colours are determined by the logo, but still, let's talk about changing them. Original author is not a professional graphic designer, so with some tweaks and whys, we are happy to change the colours.

This is what we got at the moment:

* ![#0b902d](https://dummyimage.com/32x16/0b902d/0b902d) background green (#0b902d)
* ![#d4b800](https://dummyimage.com/32x16/d4b800/d4b800) outer yellow (#d4b800)
* ![#d4b800](https://dummyimage.com/32x16/feff6f/feff6f) inner yellow (#feff6f)
* ![#898989](https://dummyimage.com/32x16/898989/898989) inner gray (#898989)

## Watermark

We want to define appearance, size and usual position of watermark for our photos.

## Our Website

We mostly want to handle our website by ourselves, but we will appreciate brand suggestions. Please help us define the basic elements, website typography and colors to meet the brand manual. Take into account that we're definitely going to use Bootstrap 4 as a base for CSS rules.

## Repertoir

We would like you to help us define how we present each of items on our Repertoir. Our audience sometimes finds it hard to differentiate among the improvised show types (explained below). Please consider (literally, not in British sense) creating customizable image template or svg icon for each of the repertoir icons.

We describe our repertoir in [a separate document](https://github.com/just-paja/polocas-napadu-static/tree/master/docs/repertoir.md).

## Notice about Open source

We would like to receive resources processable with open source applications. We expect your outputs to evolve in time as our group learns new stuff. Please avoid using proprietary file formats, like .psd (Adobe Photoshop), .ai (Adobe Illustrator). Use open standards, like [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) or [XCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCF_(file_format)) instead.

## Examples of output

Please take a moment to have a look on few of Brand Guideline examples we like. Notice the level of specificity.

* [Virgin Mobile brand manual](https://www.virginmobile.com.au/Global/virgin-mobile/static/images/style-guide/pdf/VirginMobileAUS-Print-Styleguide.pdf)
* [Carthage college brand guidelines](https://www.carthage.edu/live/files/1358-brand-guidelinespdf)
* [Boost Mobile brand manual](http://www.boostmobilebrand.com/images/common/boost-style-guide.pdf)

We generally like to read simple documents - after all, this is a manual. No need to invest time into making the document cheerful folding picture book.
